# 🐞 Bug Bounty Roadmap

### From Zero to Advanced — A Practical Beginner’s Guide

> A **complete, free, and structured roadmap** to learn Bug Bounty Hunting and Web Security from scratch.
> This repository is built with **real effort, real practice, and real resources** — no fluff.

## 🚀 Why This Repository?

Bug bounty can feel overwhelming when you’re starting out.
There are **too many tools, too many resources, and no clear path**.

This roadmap solves that by:

* Providing a **step‑by‑step learning path**
* Linking **only high‑quality resources**
* Focusing on **practice + mindset**, not just theory

If you follow this repo **in order**, you can realistically go from:

> **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced Bug Hunter**

## 🧭 How to Use This Roadmap (Recommended Order)

### 1️⃣ Start with Fundamentals

* 📘 `computernetworking.md`
* 📘 `linuxandterminal.md`

👉 Without networking & Linux basics, bug bounty will feel impossible.


### 2️⃣ Learn Core Bug Bounty Skills

* 🛠 `bugbountytools.md`
* Best way to learn `bugbountytools.md`
* 🧪 `payloads.md`

👉 Focus heavily on **Burp Suite** and **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**.


### 3️⃣ Practice Every Day

* 🧠 `morelabs.md`
* 🏁 CTFs + Online Labs

👉 Practice is **non‑negotiable**.
Reading without hacking = no progress.

---

### 4️⃣ Learn From Real Hackers

* 📚 `books.md`
* 🐞 `h1reports.md`

👉 HackerOne reports teach **real‑world thinking**, not just vulnerabilities.

---

### 5️⃣ Enter the Real Bug Bounty World

* 🌍 `bugbountyplatforms.md`

👉 Start slow. Expect duplicates. Learn scopes deeply.


## 🎯 What This Roadmap Focuses On

✔ Web Application Security
✔ Real‑world bug bounty workflows
✔ Manual testing (not blind automation)
✔ Understanding impact & exploitation
✔ Long‑term skill building

❌ No fake promises
❌ No “earn $10k in 30 days” nonsense


## 🧠 Mindset (Read This Carefully)

Bug bounty is **not fast money**.
You will face:

* Duplicates
* Rejections
* Invalid reports
* Weeks with no findings

This is normal.

> **Consistency > Talent**

If you stay disciplined and practice daily, results will come.

## 🤝 Who Is This For?

* Absolute beginners
* Students
* Self‑taught hackers
* CTF players moving to bug bounty
* Anyone tired of scattered resources
