## Step 2: Linux Operating System (Must-Have Skill)

After computer networking, the **next most important skill** in bug bounty is **Linux**.

Most servers, security tools, and hacking environments run on Linux. If you’re serious about bug bounty, **Linux is not optional**.

## 🎥 Best Linux Learning Videos (Beginner Friendly)

### 🔹 Linux Basics – Chris Titus Tech

One of the **best beginner Linux videos** I highly recommend:

👉 [https://youtu.be/10f4899srvc](https://youtu.be/10f4899srvc)

This video explains:

* What Linux is
* How it works
* Basic commands
* How to think in Linux

Chris Titus Tech explains concepts very clearly, making it perfect for beginners.


### 🔹 Linux File System (Very Important)

Understanding the Linux file system is extremely important for real-world hacking.

👉 [https://youtu.be/roES8iAaJEM](https://youtu.be/roES8iAaJEM)

This video covers:

* `/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, `/bin`, `/usr`
* Why these directories exist
* Where configs, logs, and binaries are stored

This knowledge helps a lot during exploitation and privilege escalation.


## 🖥️ Choosing the Right Linux OS for Bug Bounty

You’ll need a **security-focused Linux distribution**.

### Recommended Options:

* **Kali Linux**
* **Parrot OS**
* **BlackArch**

💡 **My personal favorite is Parrot OS**
It’s lightweight, stable, and works very smoothly—even on low-end systems.


## 🔧 Installing Parrot OS

You can follow this beginner-friendly installation guide:

You can also install **Kali Linux** if you prefer—it’s equally good for bug bounty.

## 💿 VMware vs Dual Boot (Which One to Choose?)

You can install Linux in two ways:

1. **Virtual Machine (VMware / VirtualBox)** – safer for beginners
2. **Dual Boot** – better performance but riskier if done wrong

There are many good YouTube guides for both methods. Example:

👉 [https://youtu.be/YjG1yG2l9v0](https://youtu.be/YjG1yG2l9v0)

⚠️ If you’re new, I strongly recommend **VMware first**.


## 💻 Mastering the Linux Terminal

The terminal is where you’ll spend **most of your time**.

One of the **best terminal playlists** I recommend:

👉 [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKHaKA9-4_I38sLzK134p4GJ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKHaKA9-4_I38sLzK134p4GJ)

This playlist teaches:

* Basic to advanced commands
* Pipes & redirection
* File permissions
* Real-world usage

⏳ It takes time—**be patient**. Linux is learned by daily usage, not in one day.


## 🧪 Practice Linux on TryHackMe

The **Linux Fundamentals module** on TryHackMe is perfect for practice.

👉 [https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals)

* **Part 1 is FREE**
* Beginner-friendly
* Hands-on labs
* Highly recommended


## 🧠 Final Advice for This Stage

* Don’t rush Linux
* Use it daily
* Break things and fix them
* Google errors (this is normal)

Once you’re comfortable with Linux, **everything else becomes easier** in bug bounty.
